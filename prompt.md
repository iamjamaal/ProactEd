# GitHub Copilot Prompt for ProactED Machine Learning Implementation

## Project Overview
I'm building **ProactED**, a predictive maintenance system for classroom equipment (projectors, air conditioners, podiums) at KNUST. I have a synthetic dataset with 5000+ records containing equipment sensor data, academic calendar integration, and Ghana-specific environmental factors.

## Dataset Structure
My dataset (`knust_classroom_equipment_dataset.csv`) contains:

### Equipment Features:
- `equipment_type`: projector, air_conditioner, podium
- `equipment_id`, `room_id`, `room_type`, `age_months`
- `installation_date`, `maintenance_count`, `last_maintenance_days`

### Academic Context Features:
- `week_of_year`, `is_exam_period`, `academic_usage_multiplier`
- `daily_usage_hours`, `total_usage_hours`

### Environmental Features (Ghana-specific):
- `room_temperature`, `dust_factor`, `humidity`, `season`
- `dust_accumulation`, `operating_temperature`

### Sensor Data:
- `power_consumption`, `performance_score`, `vibration_level`
- `degradation_score`

### Target Variables:
- `failure_probability` (0-1): Primary prediction target
- `maintenance_urgency`: critical, high, medium, low
- `days_to_failure`: Estimated days until failure
- `failure_type`: Equipment-specific failure modes

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Data Preprocessing Pipeline
```python
# Help me create a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline that:
# - Handles the academic calendar features properly
# - Creates time-based features for equipment lifecycle
# - Engineers domain-specific features for classroom equipment
# - Handles categorical encoding for equipment types and room types
# - Scales numerical features appropriately
# - Creates interaction features between usage patterns and environmental factors
# - Implements data validation specific to educational equipment
```

### 2. Multi-Target Prediction Models
```python
# Implement ensemble models for multiple prediction tasks:

```

### 7. Model Evaluation & Validation
```python
# Implement comprehensive evaluation:

# BUSINESS METRICS:
# - Academic_Disruption_Score = failure_prob Ã— class_schedule_impact

# - Equipment_Uptime_During_Critical_Periods (exam weeks)

# TECHNICAL METRICS:
# - Time-series cross-validation respecting academic calendar
# - Equipment-type stratified validation
# - Prediction confidence calibration
# - Model fairness across different room types and equipment ages

# CUSTOM LOSS FUNCTIONS:

2. **Zero critical equipment failures** during exam periods
3. **30% reduction** in emergency maintenance calls
4. **20% cost savings** through optimized maintenance scheduling
5. **Real-time alerts** within 15 minutes of sensor data changes

### Academic Integration Requirements:

- **Prioritize high-capacity rooms** (lecture halls > classrooms > labs)
- **Align maintenance** with academic calendar breaks
- **Escalate alerts** during high-usage periods

### Ghana-Specific Considerations:
- **Harmattan season impact** (Dec-Feb): increased dust, filter clogging
- **Power grid instability**: factor in electrical fault probabilities
- **Tropical humidity**: accelerated corrosion and electrical issues
- **Resource constraints**: optimize for local technician skills and parts availability

## Expected Deliverables:
1. **Production-ready ML models** with >85% accuracy
2. **RESTful API endpoints** for real-time predictions
3. **Background processing services** for batch predictions
4. **Interactive dashboard components** for maintenance managers

6. **Comprehensive documentation** and deployment guides
7. **Unit and integration tests** for all ML components

## Technology Stack:
- **ML Framework**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core 9.0, Entity Framework Core
- **Database**: SQL Server for predictions storage
- **Caching**: Redis for real-time predictions
- **Monitoring**: Application Insights, custom dashboards
- **Deployment**: Docker containers, Azure/AWS deployment

Please help me implement this step-by-step, starting with the data preprocessing pipeline and feature engineering specifically designed for classroom equipment in an educational environment. Focus on creating a solution that truly understands the academic context and Ghana-specific environmental factors.

The goal is to create a system that not only predicts equipment failures but does so in a way that minimizes disruption to KNUST's academic mission while optimizing maintenance resources and costs.
