EQUIPMENT FAILURE PREDICTION SYSTEM - DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
=====================================================

PACKAGE CONTENTS:
- complete_equipment_failure_prediction_system.pkl: Main model package
- production_predict_function.py: Production prediction function
- monitoring_report_*.json: Sample monitoring reports
- dashboard_data.json: Dashboard configuration
- maintenance_schedule.csv: Current maintenance recommendations

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:

1. ENVIRONMENT SETUP:
   pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib seaborn
   # Optional: pip install xgboost tensorflow

2. LOAD MODEL:
   import pickle
   with open('complete_equipment_failure_prediction_system.pkl', 'rb') as f:
       system = pickle.load(f)

3. MAKE PREDICTIONS:
   from production_predict_function import production_predict
   predictions = production_predict(new_equipment_data)

4. SETUP MONITORING:
   # Run monitoring system daily
   # Check dashboard_data.json for status updates
   # Process alerts from monitoring reports

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE:
- Model Accuracy: 47.2%
- Expected ROI: 278.2%
- Cost Savings: $4,788,800 annually

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- Reduce unexpected failures by 99.2%
- Optimize maintenance scheduling
- Minimize equipment downtime

SUPPORT:
- Model performance monitoring recommended monthly
- Retrain model quarterly with new data
- Alert threshold can be adjusted based on business needs

CUSTOMIZATION:
- Adjust business_parameters in the deployment package
- Modify alert thresholds in monitoring_config
- Update maintenance cost estimates as needed
