the dashboard is great, but these are areas to work on 
under the main dashboard, here are the things to implement 
1. "Work Instruction Summary" is not needed 
2. The equipment in focus are projectors , air conditioners, and podiums so specialisation should be based on these equipment. There should be at least 4 technicians each specialised on a particular equipment and one for general maintenane 
3. Once a maintenance is assigned to a technician, he/she should be noticed via email or sms and the maintenance should be added to the maintenance log awaiting completion 
4. If we can find a way for the technician to reply the message/email and we get the reply on the app, that will be great
under communication center: 
5. take away "radio", "team chat", and "call technician"
6. when marke acknowledged, the notification should be removed 
7.  under all equipment view, "generate equipment report" should generate equipment report
