## 📊 Usage Examples

### Basic Equipment Analysis
```python
from explainable_ai import ExplainablePredictor
import pickle

# Load model and create explainer
with open('complete_equipment_failure_prediction_system.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)
explainer = ExplainablePredictor(model=model)

# Analyze equipment
equipment_data = {
    'age_months': 24,
    'operating_temperature': 65,
    'vibration_level': 20,
    'power_consumption': 5.0,
    'humidity_level': 0.6,
    'dust_accumulation': 0.4,
    'performance_score': 0.75,
    'daily_usage_hours': 8
}

# Get explanation
explanation = explainer.explain_prediction(equipment_data, "DEMO-001")
print(f"Failure Risk: {explanation['prediction']:.1%}")
print(f"Risk Level: {explanation['risk_level']}")
```

### Natural Language Explanations
```python
from natural_language_explainer import (
    NaturalLanguageExplainer, 
    ExplanationStyle,
    explain_in_plain_english
)

# Initialize NL explainer
nl_explainer = NaturalLanguageExplainer()

# Generate business-style explanation
business_explanation = nl_explainer.generate_explanation(
    explanation, 
    ExplanationStyle.BUSINESS
)
print(business_explanation["main_explanation"])

# Quick plain English explanation
simple_explanation = explain_in_plain_english(explanation, "simple")
print(simple_explanation)
```

### Conversational Q&A
```python
from natural_language_explainer import generate_conversation_qa

# Generate Q&A pairs
qa_pairs = generate_conversation_qa(explanation)

for qa in qa_pairs:
    print(f"Q: {qa['question']}")
    print(f"A: {qa['answer']}")
    print("---")
```
