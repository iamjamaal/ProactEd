- `POST /api/equipment/batch-predict` - Batch predictions  
- `GET /api/health` - Service health check
- `GET /api/model/info` - Model information

---

## 🔄 **Next Steps for Your Colleague**

### **Step 1: Copy .NET Files** (2 minutes)
Your colleague needs to copy these files to their .NET project:
- `EquipmentPredictionService.cs`
- `EquipmentPredictionController.cs` (optional - for reference)

### **Step 2: Install NuGet Package** (1 minute)
```
Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json
```

### **Step 3: Register Service** (2 minutes)
Add to their `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs`:
```csharp
services.AddScoped(provider => new EquipmentPredictionService("http://localhost:5000"));
```

### **Step 4: Use in Code** (5 minutes)
```csharp
// In any controller or service
public async Task<IActionResult> CheckEquipment(string equipmentId)
{
    var equipmentData = new EquipmentData
    {
        EquipmentId = equipmentId,
        AgeMonths = 24,
        OperatingTemperature = 75.5,
        VibrationLevel = 2.3,
        PowerConsumption = 150.0
    };
    
    var prediction = await _predictionService.PredictEquipmentFailureAsync(equipmentData);
    
    if (prediction.Success && prediction.RiskLevel == "Critical")
    {
        // Handle critical equipment - trigger maintenance workflow
        await ScheduleEmergencyMaintenance(equipmentId);
    }
    
    return Json(prediction);
}
```

## 🎯 **Integration Benefits**

### **For Your Colleague's .NET App:**
- ✅ **Real-time predictions** - Get ML results instantly
- ✅ **Batch processing** - Analyze multiple equipment at once
- ✅ **Risk categorization** - Automatic Low/Medium/High/Critical classification
- ✅ **Confidence scores** - Know how reliable each prediction is
- ✅ **Health monitoring** - Check if ML service is working
- ✅ **Error handling** - Graceful handling of API issues

### **Technical Advantages:**
- ✅ **Loose coupling** - Systems remain independent
- ✅ **Scalable** - Can handle multiple .NET clients
- ✅ **Maintainable** - Update ML model without touching .NET code
- ✅ **Testable** - Both systems can be tested independently

---

## 📊 **Integration Test Results**

### **API Performance:**
```
Health Check: ✅ PASSED - Service is healthy
Model Info: ✅ PASSED - Model details retrieved
Single Prediction: ✅ PASSED - Individual equipment analysis working
Batch Prediction: ✅ PASSED - Multiple equipment analysis working  
Error Handling: ✅ PASSED - Invalid requests handled gracefully

Overall Success Rate: 100% (5/5 tests passed)
```

### **Sample Prediction Results:**
```
Equipment ID: TEST_001
Failure Probability: 0.862 (86.2%)
Risk Level: Critical
Confidence Score: 0.277
Model: Random Forest (Retrained)
Recommended Action: IMMEDIATE MAINTENANCE REQUIRED
```

---

## 🔧 **Deployment Options**

### **Option 1: Same Server (Recommended for Start)**
- Keep Python API running on port 5000
- .NET app uses `http://localhost:5000`
- Easy setup, good for testing

### **Option 2: Separate Servers (Production)**
- Deploy Python API on dedicated ML server
- Update .NET config to point to ML server
- Better scalability and isolation

### **Option 3: Docker (Enterprise)**
- Containerize both applications
- Use docker-compose for orchestration
- Production-ready, highly scalable
